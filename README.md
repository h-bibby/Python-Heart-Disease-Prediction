## Heart Disease Prediction

This project uses supervised classification machine learning techniques to predict heart disease from 11 features about patients health.

### Data
Kaggle ‘Heart Failure Prediction Dataset’.

https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/heart-failure-prediction

Features - age, sex, chest pain type, resting BP, cholesterol, fasting BS, resting ECG, max heart rate, exercise angina, old peak and ST slope.

### Pre-Processing and EDA
- Missing Values
- Encoding
- Error Checking
- Outlier Detection
- Variable Investigations
- Class Imbalance
- Multicollinearity
- Feature and Target Plots
- Standardisation

### Models
- Decision Tree
- KNN

(both use parameter optimisation and feature selection)
